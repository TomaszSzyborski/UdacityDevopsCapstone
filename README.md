# UdacityDevopsCapstone

Project scope:
Project is self-made application for REST API trainees - I already conducted a handful of trainings based on this application.
The application itself is REST-API RPG-like game that takes user on different stories - e.g. Chernobyl Reactor Test, COVID-19 research,
Diatlov Pass event and even Cryptography Agency.
The usage of application is gamificaton - each time a major event iccurs the player receives a flag like in CTF competitions.
Games can be completed using various tools like Google Postman or in automated manner - e.g. Python Requests or Java RestAssured.


Pipepline plan:
1. Scan for code style
2. Configure infrastructure
3. Deploy application
4. If any step fails - roll it back, destroying the stack.
